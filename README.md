**Ring Road Marketplace – A Safer Way for Students to Buy & Sell**

Created by Kyle Dang, Shrujan Sriram, Eric Zheng, Steven Kuzhipala during UCI WebJam 2025. Part of the top 8 projects presented!

**Inspiration**

Students often rely on public platforms like Facebook Marketplace to trade items, which means dealing with strangers and safety risks. We wanted to build a solution that keeps transactions within the trusted UCI community.

**What It Does**
UCI Marketplace is a student-exclusive platform where users log in with their UCI emails to list, browse, and filter items by category and location. Buyers can directly contact sellers to complete the sale on their own terms.

**How We Built It**
We developed a secure web app that requires a UCI email, provides a clean user interface, and a backend system for managing listings and search filters.

**Challenges**
Some challenges we faced were finding creative ways to differentiate our web app from other marketplaces.

**What We Learned**
We strengthened our full-stack development skills, improved team collaboration, and discovered how to turn a real student problem into a working solution.

**What’s Next**
We want to add in-app messaging, secure payments, and user ratings to make the marketplace even safer and more seamless.
